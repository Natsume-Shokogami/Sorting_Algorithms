# Sorting_Algorithms
#This includes all files (except the .exe file) in my codes of lab_03 n Data Structures & Algorithms class.
#There're still some issues in my codes, you can change them and commit your changes here.
#-All citations about the algorithms are in the comments between the functions
#-There may still some bugs in my codes, fix if you found them
#-The comparison count in the functions can be overflowed due to large initial data sizes (up to 500 000 elements), please change "int &count_cmp" to long long instead (The reason I didn't change that because I dont know the limit of long long in different compilers).
#-Heap sort and quick sort still have stack overflow problem when size of initial data > 120000, so if you have a Linux computer (which has higher default stack memory than Windows),or if you can change the initial stack memory when compiling, please compile and tell me if they can output the results.
